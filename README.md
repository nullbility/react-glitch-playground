# React Glitch Playground!

This is initially a place to develop cool glitchy things maybe, though it will eventually become a boilerplate and import the glitch components from a library, maybe called react-glitch? Maybe it'll be taken. But it's a good name.

# Installing/Running

1) Clone the repo locally
3) run `npm install`
4) run `npm start`

And that's it! Make sure nothing is running on localhost:3000 or else there will be a collision.
